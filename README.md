This package is intended to add OAuth consumer and provider support to any Concrete5 website.

Once installed and configured users may be allowed to used their OAuth enabled accounts
to signup with your site.

This currently no documentation available, as most options are configurable from the dashboard.

Helper classes are included as part of this package and may be use by developers 
looking to further use the functionality offered by OAuth.

Currently there is no single method for accessing the underlying network APIS. However the client
classes are extensions of the original SDKs made available and have their methods available.

TODO
* Add the create a suitable pass-through method for accessing the underlying APIs.
